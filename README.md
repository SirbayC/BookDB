# BookDB
- A basic React Node.js MySQL website to showcase CRUD operations, using npm as a package manager,
express json middleware and axios for REST requests

## To run
- Run the server (backend folder) through `npm start`
- Run the client either through `npm start`, or, optimized, through `npm run build`, then `serve -s build`
(may require running `npm install -g serve` first to install the server deployment service)
